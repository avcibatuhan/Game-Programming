-Third person movement (W,A,S,D)
-Position changing when trigger the wall (using save and load system)
-Basic menu system (its include play,info and quit)
-AI follow system (Enemies are always following your position)
-Basic score system at the top of the screen.
-Finally its includes basic save and load system.When the game is start script is saving our position and rotation.If enemy catch us and triggered us script load the saved positions and rotations.It's like if your get caught game is restarting.
